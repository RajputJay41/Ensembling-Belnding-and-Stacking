Ive shown each and everyway how to blend and stack with bunch of algortihms then its all up to you. how you use them.

keep in mind that for every algorithm you apply, you have to use the same folds which you have created.

Dataset:-  https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial

First Downnload the dataset then create the folds and then you can take charge which algorithms you want to use
ive used linear regression, Logistic regression , Random forest and xgboost
